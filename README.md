## Description
 
The non-profitable organization in Kitchener-Waterloo area of Ontario comes with the vision and a mission in their mind to respectfully and compassionately empower persons who are homeless with the hope of providing emergency and temporary shelter with the help of our volunteers. Our dedicated volunteers tend to serve who are in real need, and help them by providing clothing and food which are the basic necessities for the survival. In addition, our centers offer educational support to interested citizens who don’t have enough resources but still want to educate themselves. The site completely runs upon the donations of the people who do like our work, and want to appreciate us in some way. The organization works with the motive of removing the barriers from people’s life and instead, comes with the mindset of solving any problem they comes across.

## Target Market

The purpose and goals of this website is to attract the people which may include volunteers or the people who want to help others who are in real need are the primary target audience. To elaborate, people who can help in any kind whether its small or big, doesn’t matter. People who can help by raising awareness for the basic motive of helping others can also be a secondary target audience we are looking for.

This aspect will surely influence the design as it will be created according to the psychology of people of all age groups, making sure that the colors are vibrant enough, and do not create problems for the one who have disabilities. Also, in order to look to have an easy focus on the website, the font size of text should be big enough so that it can be easily accessible to all. Overall, the website will be following and addressing its content according to the principles derived laid by the WCAG guidelines.
